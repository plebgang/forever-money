# SN98 ForeverMoney

**Decentralized Automated Liquidity Management on Bittensor**

## Quick Summary

SN98 ForeverMoney is a Bittensor subnet that optimizes Uniswap V3 / Aerodrome liquidity provision through competitive AI strategies. Miners propose dynamic rebalancing decisions, validators evaluate performance through forward simulations, and winning strategies get executed on-chain on Base L2.

**Key Features:**
- **Jobs-Based Architecture** - Multiple liquidity pools managed concurrently
- **Dual-Mode Operation** - Evaluation rounds (all miners) + Live rounds (winners only)
- **Rebalance-Only Protocol** - Miners decide when and how to adjust positions
- **Per-Job Reputation** - Miners build scores for specific trading pairs
- **7-Day Participation Requirement** - Consistent performance needed for live execution

## How It Works

Validators run multiple jobs (liquidity management tasks) concurrently. For each job:

1. **Evaluation Rounds** - All miners compete in forward simulations from current blockchain state
2. **Live Rounds** - Winning miners (after 7 days participation) execute strategies on-chain
3. **Scoring** - Miners scored on absolute inventory protection and value growth
4. **Reputation** - Build per-job scores through exponential moving averages

**Current Scoring (PoL Target):**
- Maximize value growth from pool price appreciation and fees (primary signal)
- Smooth exponential penalty for losing inventory (% of tokens lost)
- Score = value_gain × exp(-10 × loss%) if gaining, value_gain / exp(-10 × loss%) if losing
- 10% inventory loss → 63% score reduction; 50% loss → 99% reduction

For detailed system architecture see **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## For Miners

**Getting Started:** Implement a `rebalance_query_handler` that responds to `RebalanceQuery` requests from validators. Accept/refuse jobs and return desired positions (rebalance or keep current). Build reputation through consistent participation for 7 days to become eligible for live execution.

**Run Your Miner:**
```bash
python -m miner.miner --wallet.name <wallet> --wallet.hotkey <hotkey>
```

For complete implementation guide, scoring details, and code examples, see **[MINER_GUIDE.md](./MINER_GUIDE.md)**.
